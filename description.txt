Adds a simple configuration mod that allows you to modify the stats and apply modifiers to NPCs (including modded) of your choosing.

Includes modifying:
[list]
[*] Health
[*] Damage dealt
[*] Defense
[*] Size 
[*] Movement Speed
[*] AI Speed
[*] Gravity
[*] Life regen / damage over time
[/list]

[h1]IMPORTANT![/h1]
Changes to config only take affect on newly spawned NPCs (or upon world reload).

Extreme values can cause issues, so be cautious.

This mod tries its best to override values but isn't perfect. Expect there to be bugs especially with other mods.
There is little I can do without manually patching NPCs in every mod.

[h1]F.A.Q.[/h1]
[h3]How to use?[/h3]
While in your world goto:
Settings > Mod Configuration > Simple NPC Customizer > Config

[h3]Does this mod work in multiplayer?[/h3]
It should! But has not been extensively tested.

If there are any bugs, crashes, or any features you'd like to recommend. Please go ahead :)
